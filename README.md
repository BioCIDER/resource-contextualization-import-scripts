# resource-contextualizationâ€”import-scripts

Data import and control Layer

> Python scripts to import data from different sources. 

## Getting Started

You need a proper **python** interpreter for your system. Download it from [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Version tested with this application is 2.7.

Also, you need to install **APScheduler** to be able to run the importing synchronization script. Download it from  [APScheduler downloads](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/APScheduler/) 

After downloading it, you only need to execute

sudo python setup.py install

Last version tested is 3.0.3


### synchronizer.py

This script manages which specific scripts are executed, and when they are. To add a new one, you need to upload it to /specific folder and add it its main() function to PROCESSES list.

Currently, all processes are executed asynchronously every hour.

See CRON documentation at : [APScheduler docs](http://apscheduler.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/triggers/cron.html) 

### Specific importing scripts

Currently we have 3 different specific scripts into /specific folder: **ckanData.py** (to import ELIXIR training materials), **iannData.py** (events data) and **registryData.py** (ELIXIR records).

You can execute them independently or through synchronizer.py.
